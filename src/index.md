# Hi I'm Joss.

I'm teaching myself to code. Here are some projects that I've made:

* [acc](https://github.com/jaf7C7/acc)
  - A CLI tool for tracking your finances, written in Python.
* [tictactoe](https://github.com/jaf7C7/tictactoe)
  - Tic-tac-toe in the terminal.
* [cmt](https://github.com/jaf7C7/cmt)
  - A Unix filter for toggling different kinds of comments. Written for use with `vi`.
* [linked-list-python](https://github.com/jaf7C7/linked-list-python)
  - A singly linked list implemented in Python.
* [shtest](https://github.com/jaf7C7/shtest)
  - A very simple testing framework written in POSIX shell.
